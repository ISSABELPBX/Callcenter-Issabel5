It uses the [AsteriskÂ©](http://www.asterisk.org/ "Asterisk Home Page") open source PBX software as its core.

Call Center
----

Call Center module for Issabel. Changes to make it work with Asterisk 13


Manual Modifications for Testing
----

In order to test, some changes are needed in the Asterisk dialplan, in
/etc/asterisk/extensions_custom.conf create a new context:

```
[agents]
exten = _X.,1,NoOp()
same = n,AgentRequest(${EXTEN})
same = n,Congestion()
```

This context will be used to dial to a particular logged in Agent.

Then in agents.conf you must use this format for agents:

```
[1000]
fullname=Pedro
autologoff=15
ackcall=yes
acceptdtmf=##
```

Finally you should add agents into queues with a special format. From
the Asterisk CLI you can try something like this:

```
queue add member Local/1000@agents/n to 2000 penalty 0 as "Agente 1000" state_interface Agent:1000
```
